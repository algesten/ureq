//! HTTP/1.1 data transport.
//!
//! _NOTE: Transport is deep configuration of ureq and is not required for regular use._
//!
//! ureq provides a pluggable transport layer making it possible to write bespoke
//! transports using the HTTP/1.1 protocol from point A to B. The
//! [`Agent::with_parts()`](crate::Agent::with_parts) constructor takes an implementation
//! of the [`Connector`] trait which is used for all connections made using that
//! agent.
//!
//! The [DefaultConnector] covers the regular needs for HTTP/1.1:
//!
//! * TCP Sockets
//! * SOCKS-proxy sockets
//! * HTTPS/TLS using rustls (feature flag **rustls**)
//! * HTTPS/TLS using native-tls (feature flag **native-tls** + [config](crate::tls::TlsProvider::NativeTls))
//!
//! The [`Connector`] trait anticipates a chain of connectors that each decide
//! whether to help perform the connection or not. It is for instance possible to make a
//! connector handling other schemes than `http`/`https` without affecting "regular" connections
//! using these schemes. See [`ChainedConnector`] for a helper connector that aids setting
//! up a chain of concrete connectors.
