A simple, safe HTTP client.

Ureq's first priority is being easy for you to use. It's great for
anyone who wants a low-overhead HTTP client that just gets the job done. Works
very well with HTTP APIs. Its features include cookies, JSON, HTTP proxies,
HTTPS, interoperability with the `http` crate, and charset decoding.

Ureq is in pure Rust for safety and ease of understanding. It avoids using
`unsafe` directly. It [uses blocking I/O][blocking] instead of async I/O, because that keeps
the API simple and keeps dependencies to a minimum. For TLS, ureq uses
[rustls or native-tls](#https--tls--ssl).

See the [changelog] for details of recent releases.

[blocking]: #blocking-io-for-simplicity
[changelog]: https://github.com/algesten/ureq/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

## Usage

In its simplest form, ureq looks like this:

```rust
let body: String = ureq::get("http://example.com")
    .header("Example-Header", "header value")
    .call()?
    .body_mut()
    .read_to_string()?;
```

For more involved tasks, you'll want to create an [Agent]. An Agent
holds a connection pool for reuse, and a cookie store if you use the
**cookies** feature. An Agent can be cheaply cloned due to internal
[Arc](std::sync::Arc) and all clones of an Agent share state among each other. Creating
an Agent also allows setting options like the TLS configuration.

```rust
use ureq::{Agent, AgentConfig, Timeouts};
use std::time::Duration;

let agent: Agent = AgentConfig {
    timeouts: Timeouts {
        global: Some(Duration::from_secs(5)),
        ..Default::default()
    },
    ..Default::default()
}.into();

let body: String = agent.get("http://example.com/page")
    .call()?
    .body_mut()
    .read_to_string()?;

// Reuses the connection from previous request.
let response: String = agent.put("http://example.com/upload")
    .header("Authorization", "example-token")
    .send("some body data")?
    .body_mut()
    .read_to_string()?;
```

### JSON

Ureq supports sending and receiving json, if you enable the **json** feature:

```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct MySendBody {
   thing: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct MyRecvBody {
   other: String,
}

let send_body = MySendBody { thing: "yo".to_string() };

// Requires the `json` feature enabled.
let recv_body = ureq::post("http://example.com/post/ingest")
    .header("X-My-Header", "Secret")
    .send_json(&send_body)?
    .body_mut()
    .read_json::<MyRecvBody>()?;
```

### Error handling

ureq returns errors via `Result<T, ureq::Error>`. That includes I/O errors,
protocol errors. By default, also HTTP status code errors (when the
server responded 4xx or 5xx) results in `Error`.

This behavior can be turned off via [`AgentConfig::http_status_as_error`].

```rust
use ureq::Error;

match ureq::get("http://mypage.example.com/").call() {
    Ok(response) => { /* it worked */},
    Err(Error::StatusCode(code)) => {
        /* the server returned an unexpected status
           code (such as 400, 500 etc) */
    }
    Err(_) => { /* some kind of io/transport/etc error */ }
}
```

## Features

To enable a minimal dependency tree, some features are off by default.
You can control them when including ureq as a dependency.

`ureq = { version = "3", features = ["socks-proxy", "charset"] }`

The default enabled features are: **rustls**, **gzip** and **json**.

* **rustls** enabled the rustls TLS implementation. This is the defeault for the the crate level
  convenience calls (`ureq::get` etc).
* **native-tls** enables the native tls backend for TLS. Due to the risk of diamond dependencies
  accidentally switching on an unwanted TLS implementation, `native-tls` is never picked up as
  a default or used by the crate level convenience calls (`ureq::get` etc) â€“ it must be configured
  on the agent.
* **socks-proxy** enables proxy config using the `socks4://`, `socks4a://`, `socks5://`
   and `socks://` (equal to `socks5://`) prefix.
* **cookies** enables cookies.
* **gzip** enables requests of gzip-compressed responses and decompresses them.
* **brotli** enables requests brotli-compressed responses and decompresses them.
* **charset** enables interpreting the charset part of the Content-Type header
   (e.g.  `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1`). Without this, the
   library defaults to Rust's built in `utf-8`.
* **json** enables JSON sending and receiving via serde_json.

## JSON

By enabling the **json** feature, the library supports serde json.

This is enabled by default.

* [`request.send_json()`][RequestBuilder::send_json()] send body as json.
* [`body.read_json()`][Body::read_json()] transform response to json.

## Sending body data

HTTP/1.1 has two ways of transfering body data. Either of a known size with
the `Content-Length` HTTP header, or unknown size with the
`Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header. ureq supports both and will use the
appropriate method depending on which body is being sent.

ureq has a [`AsSendBody`] trait that is implemented for many well known types
of data that we might want to send. The request body can thus be anything
from a `String` to a `File`, see below.

### Content-Length

The library will send a `Content-Length` header on requests with bodies of
known size, in other words, if the body to send is one of:

* `&[u8]`
* `&[u8; N]`
* `&str`
* `String`
* `&String`
* `Vec<u8>`
* `&Vec<u8>)`
* [`SendBody::from_json()`] (implicitly via [`RequestBuilder::send_json()`])

### Transfer-Encoding: chunked

ureq will send a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header on requests where the body
is of unknown size. The body is automatically converted to an [`std::io::Read`]
when the type is one of:

* `File`
* `&File`
* `TcpStream`
* `&TcpStream`
* `Stdin`
* `UnixStream` (not on windows)

#### From readers

The chunked method also applies for bodies constructed via:

* [`SendBody::from_reader()`]
* [`SendBody::from_owned_reader()`]

### Proxying a response body

As a special case, when ureq sends a [`Body`] from a previous http call, the
use of `Content-Length` or `chunked` depends on situation. For input such as
gzip decoding (**gzip** feature) or charset transformation (**charset** feature),
the output body might not match the input, which means ureq is forced to use
the `chunked` method.

* `Response<Body>`

### Overriding

If you set your own Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header before
sending the body, ureq will respect that header by not overriding it,
and by encoding the body or not, as indicated by the headers you set.

```rust
let resp = ureq::put("https://httpbin.org/put")
    .header("Transfer-Encoding", "chunked")
    .send("Hello world")?;
```

## Character encoding

By enabling the **charset** feature, the library supports sending/receiving other
character sets than `utf-8`.

For [`Body::read_to_string()`] we read the header like:

`Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1`

and if it contains a charset specification, we try to decode the body using that
encoding. In the absence of, or failing to interpret the charset, we fall back on `utf-8`.

Similarly when using [`request.send()`][RequestBuilder::send()] with a text body,
we first check if the user has set a `; charset=<whatwg charset>` and attempt
to encode the request body using that.

### Lossy utf-8

When reading text bodies (with a `Content-Type` starting `text/` as in `text/plain`,
`text/html`, etc), ureq can ensure the body is possible to read as a `String` also if
it contains characters that are not valid for utf-8. Invalid characters are replaced
with a question mark `?` (NOT the utf-8 replacement character).

For [`Body::read_to_string()`] this is turned on by default, but it can be disabled
and conversely for [`Body::as_reader()`] it is not enabled, but can be.

To precisely configure the behavior use [`Body::with_config()`].

## Proxying

ureq supports two kinds of proxies,  [`HTTP`] ([`CONNECT`]), [`SOCKS4`]/[`SOCKS5`],
the former is always available while the latter must be enabled using the feature
**socks-proxy**.

Proxies settings are configured on an [Agent]. All request sent through the agent will be proxied.

[`HTTP`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Proxy_servers_and_tunneling#http_tunneling
[`CONNECT`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/CONNECT
[`SOCKS4`]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS#SOCKS4
[`SOCKS5`]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS#SOCKS5

### Example using HTTP

```rust
use ureq::{Agent, AgentConfig, Proxy};
// Configure an http connect proxy.
let proxy = Proxy::new("http://user:password@cool.proxy:9090")?;
let agent: Agent = AgentConfig {
    proxy: Some(proxy),
    ..Default::default()
}.into();

// This is proxied.
let resp = agent.get("http://cool.server").call()?;
```

### Example using SOCKS5

```rust
use ureq::{Agent, AgentConfig, Proxy};
// Configure a SOCKS proxy.
let proxy = Proxy::new("socks5://user:password@cool.proxy:9090")?;
let agent: Agent = AgentConfig {
    proxy: Some(proxy),
    ..Default::default()
}.into();

// This is proxied.
let resp = agent.get("http://cool.server").call()?;
```
