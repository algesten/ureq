# 1.5.0
 * Add pluggable name resolution. Users can now override the IP addresses for
   hostnames of their choice (#148).
 * bugfix: Don't re-pool streams on drop. This would occur if the user called
   `response.into_reader()` and dropped the resulting `Read` before reading all
   the way to EOF. The result would be a BadStatus error on the next request to
   the same hostname. This only affected users using an explicit Agent (#160).
 * Automatically set Transfer-Encoding: chunked when using `send` (#86).
 * `into_reader()` now returns `impl Read + Send` instead of `impl Read` (#156).
 * Add support for log crate (#170).
 * Retry broken connections in more cases (should reduce BadStatus errors; #168).

# 1.4.1

 * Use buffer to avoid byte-by-byte parsing result in multiple syscalls.
 * Allow pooling multiple connections per host.
 * Put version in user agent "ureq/1.4.1".

# 1.4.0

  * Propagate WouldBlock in io:Error for Response::to_json.
  * Merge multiple cookies into one header to be spec compliant.
  * Allow setting TLSConnector for native-tls.
  * Remove brackets against TLS lib when IPv6 addr is used as hostname.
  * Include proxy in connection pool keys.
  * Stop assuming localhost for URLs without host part.
  * Error if body length is less than content-length.
  * Validate header names.

# 1.3.0

  * Changelog start
